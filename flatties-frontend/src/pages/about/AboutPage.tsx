      <h3>Benjamin Polglase:</h3>
      <p>
        I'm recent graduate who decided to make a career shift to follow my
        passion for technology and problem-solving. The aspects of software
        development I enjoy the most are collaborating with others, creating
        real solutions and the constant learning that is required. Beyond the
        world of coding, you'll find me immersed in my love for football,
        curating a diverse collection of records, and indulging in my interests
        in history and movies. Excited about this new chapter, I bring not only
        technical skills but also a rich set of experiences and interests to the
        software realm.
